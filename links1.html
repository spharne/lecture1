            Phishing involves fraudulent communications – most commonly emails – that appear to originate from a reputable source.
These messages are designed to trick recipients into doing a variety of things, including disclosing sensitive information, clicking on links that will inject malware into the recipient’s device, or transferring money directly to cybercriminals.
Phishing scams have been prevalent since the start of the pandemic, as cybercrooks quickly seized the opportunity to exploit the fear, anxiety, and uncertainty generated by the health crisis, as well as the public’s hunger for information about the virus.
